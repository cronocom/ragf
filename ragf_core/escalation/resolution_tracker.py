Escalation Resolution Tracking & Simulation
Author: Yamil Rodriguez (Reflexio Studio)

⚠️ IMPORTANT — SIMULATED DATA, NOT MEASURED HUMAN DECISIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------
This module defines two distinct things:

  1. EscalationResolution / ResolutionAnalyzer
     Data structures and metrics that WOULD operate on real operator
     decisions if such data were collected.

  2. ResolutionSimulator (and the helpers `_determine_outcome`,
     `_generate_rationale`)
     A DETERMINISTIC SIMULATOR that fabricates plausible operator
     decisions from escalation logs using:
       - SHA-256-based outcome mapping (sha256(escalation_id) % 100), and
       - experience-stratified deviation drawn from published
         human-factors / clinical decision-making literature.

The inter-operator agreement figures reported in the paper and in
ESCALATION_ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md (≈95% aviation / ≈94% healthcare) are produced
by this SIMULATOR. They are MODELED ESTIMATES, NOT observed agreement between
human operators. No systematic multi-operator review was performed.

Do NOT cite the simulator output as empirical evidence of operator consistency.
Empirical multi-operator measurement is required future work.
